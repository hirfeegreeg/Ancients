        <p>Hii! I'm Mab, 14 years old as of 2025. I'm a 3D modeller and Writer! I always love to chat with people online and love drawing! I have a lot of mental illness so please be understanding if I start acting different that what you might expect from others. A lot of people think I'm a part of the lgbtq+ community, I'm not,  so please don't say that I am. Region: Europe. Gender: Female. Here is a quote that I came up with, feel free to use it but always give full credit: "Life is like a mountain, people are always blinded by it's peak that by the time they reach the top, the way they can go is down. So never aim for the peak, but embrace the experience climbing it. For it is not the peak that makes us stronger, but the climb towards it."</p>

More importantly, I’m a core member of the project. In the main server, I’m currently a Writer, Voice Actor, and Helper/Staff Member, working closely with the creator, Marian, and mods. I’m also a key member in a multitude of different teams for this project. In the biggest team of the server, Block Motion Studios, I’m a Manager and Head of Voice Acting. I’m also a writer in teams like Book n Quill. More importantly, in the team The Ancients, I’m a Voice Actor and Writer. While I don’t have any experience, I am skilled in both Voice Acting and Writing. DM me if you want me to assist in any project you’re making! Hope to see you around!

          I'm 14 years old
          
          I like games that are so hard that are gonna make me cry of frustration, mainly souls games and platformer games. I'm Christian, I'm straight, I'm training to be artist and VA, but I'm currently just a writer, but I can be VA too if you are looking for a deep voice, I currently direct some mods for some games and I'm also directing an indie game, that will probably take a while to come out because there's 4 people on the team.
          
          My favorite games are:
          
          - Elden Ring
          - Sekiro
          - Celeste
          - Cuphead
          - Ultrakill
          - Megaman (All of Megaman, including all the X series, Zero series, ZX series, etc)
